AB  - MAJOR SALIVARY GLANDS OF BOTH HUMANS AND RODENTS CONSIST OF THREE PAIRS OF
      MACROSCOPIC GLANDS: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual. These glands secrete
      serous, mucous or mixed saliva via the proper main excretory ducts connecting the
      glandular bodies with the oral cavity. A series of discoveries about the salivary
      ducts in the 17th century by Niels Stensen (1638-1686), Thomas Wharton (1614-1673),
      and Caspar Bartholin (1655-1738) established the concept of exocrine secretion as
      well as salivary glands. Recent investigations have revealed the endocrine functions
      of parotin and a variety of cell growth factors produced by salivary glands.The
      present review aims to describe macroscopic findings on the major salivary glands of
      rodents and the microscopic differences between those of humans and rodents, which
      review should be of interest to those researchers studying salivary glands.
